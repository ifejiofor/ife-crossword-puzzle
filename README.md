# ife-crossword-puzzle

This is a simple crossword puzzle game I developed back in 2015.
I developed it in C language with the CodeBlocks IDE.
It is an interesting game that uses the command-line interface.

NB: If you want to run the game but do not have CodeBlocks IDE installed in your computer, simply run the a.exe file in this folder.
